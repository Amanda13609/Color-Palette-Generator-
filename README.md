## Challenges
- pip should have Pygame installed
- research Pygame.color  https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/color.html

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The code should print out the question "Would you like to generate a color?" and have a yes and no input as a loop.
-  When color is generated a window should pop up displaying the color and the terminal should display RGB numbers
-  exiting out of the window displays the loop question

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- able to print out question with input
- generates color RGB number in the terminal
- window display color using pygame
